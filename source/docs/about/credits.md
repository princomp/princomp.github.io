## Purpose

This website contains all the resources to learn the principles of computer programming using C#.
It is used in the delivery of CSCI 1301 - Principles of Computer Programming I and CSCI 1302 - Principles of Computer Programming II in the [Bachelor of Science in Computer Science](https://www.augusta.edu/ccs/bs-cs.php) at [Augusta University](https://www.augusta.edu), and contains practical guides and additional resources for students and instructors.

## Authors

At the time of writing, this resource is actively maintained [Clément Aubert](https://spots.augusta.edu/caubert/#contact). 
Additional contributions, by [(under)graduate course assistants](/docs/academic_life/ca) and other contributors, are [tracked by version control](https://github.com/princomp/princomp.github.io/graphs/contributors).

Some of the material originated from discussion, handouts and contributions by [Clément Aubert](http://spots.augusta.edu/caubert/), [Aubrey Bryant](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aubrey-bryant-61898176), [Michael Dowell](https://spots.augusta.edu/mdowell/), [Richard DeFrancisco](https://www.augusta.edu/faculty/directory/view.php?id=RDEFRANCISCO),  [Onyeka Ezenwoye](https://www.augusta.edu/faculty/directory/view.php?id=oezenwoye), [Leszek Gasieniec](https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~leszek/),  [Reza Rahaeimehr](https://www.augusta.edu/faculty/directory/view.php?id=RRAHAEIMEHR), [Neea Rusch](https://nkrusch.github.io/), [Edward Tremel](https://edwardtremel.com/) and [Paul York](https://www.augusta.edu/faculty/directory/view.php?id=pyork1).

Additionally, the [School of Computer & Cyber Sciences](https://www.augusta.edu/ccs/)'s past and present [academic advisors](https://www.augusta.edu/ccs/faculty.php#administration), Laura Austin, Denise Coleman, Markus Bacha, and Wennie Squires, and communications & marketing specialist, Haley Bourne, improved the [Academic Life](/docs/academic_life) notes through their suggestions and references.

## Supports

The first source of support is the constant stream of feedback we receive from students and users: thank _you_.

## Tools

We strive to prioritize open-source software when possible, and occasionally contribute to them.

### Software

This website uses different technologies.

- The markdown source code is converted to (a slightly different) `md`, `pdf`, `odt` and `docx` formats thanks to [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and [pandoc-include](https://github.com/DCsunset/pandoc-include) (among other `lua` filters).
- The `pdf` format is compiled using [XeLaTeX](https://tug.org/xetex/).
- The source code is highlighted thanks to [Pygments](https://pygments.org/).
- The website is powered by [quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/).

More details on the tools we use and how this resource is made can be found in [dev. guide](dev_guide).

### Fonts

We use the [URW Gothic](https://fontesk.com/gothic-typeface/) and [Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) (inspired by the [DejaVu](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) font) fonts.
Those fonts have been specially selected for their legibility and [lower impact on environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_Gothic#Printer_ink_usage).

### Services

The source code and the website are graciously hosted and built by [github](https://github.com/).
