# Queues (Solutions)

## Multiple Choices

#. A queue is generally endowed with operations called…
   
        - [ ] Requeue
        - [x] Dequeue
        - [x] Enqueue
        - [ ] Unqueue
        
#. A queue implements which principle?
    
        - [ ] LIFO
        - [x] FIFO 
        - [ ] LILO
        - [ ] FOFI

#. LIFO stands for…
    
        - [ ] Least Is First Out
        - [ ] Last Is First Outside
        - [x] Last In First Out
        - [ ] Low Input Fast Output

## Exercises

#. Suppose given an empty `Queue` object, and assume that we store the values 10 and 20 (in that order), and then remove one and insert 30. Draw the resulting queue, labelling explicitly the front (or beginning) and end of your queue.

    <summary>Solution</summary>
    We get: (end ->) 30 ; 20 (<- front).
    </details>
