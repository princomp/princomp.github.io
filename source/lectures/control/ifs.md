## if Statements

### Introduction

- Recall from a previous lecture (Booleans and Comparisons) that decision structures change the flow of code execution based on conditions
- Now that we know how to write conditions in C#, we can write decision structures
- Our first decision structure is the **if statement**, which executes a block of code *only if a condition is true*

### Example code with an `if` statement

```
Console.WriteLine("Enter your age");
int age = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
if (age >= 18)
{
    Console.WriteLine("You can vote!");
}
Console.WriteLine("Goodbye");
```

- After the keyword `if` is a condition, in parentheses: `age >= 18`
- On the next line after the `if` statement, the curly brace begins a code block. The code in this block is "controlled" by the `if` statement.
- If the condition `age >= 18` is true, the code in the block (the WriteLine statement with the text "You can vote!") gets executed, then execution proceeds to the next line (the WriteLine statement that prints "Goodbye")
- If the condition `age >= 18` is false, the code in the block gets *skipped*, and execution proceeds directly to the line that prints "Goodbye"
- The behavior of this program can be represented by this flowchart:

    !["A flowchart representation of an if statement"](img/activity_diag_vote_if)

- Example interaction 1:

    ```text
    Enter your age
    20
    You can vote!
    Goodbye
    ```

    When the user enters "20", the value 20 is assigned to the `age` variable, so the condition `age >= 18` is true. This means the code inside the `if` statement's block gets executed.

- Example interaction 2:

    ```text
    Enter your age
    17
    Goodbye
    ```

    When the user enters "17", the value 17 is assigned to the `age` variable, so the condition `age >= 18` is false, and the `if` statement's code block gets skipped.

### Syntax and rules for if statements

- Formally, the syntax for an `if` statement is this:

    ```
    if (<condition>)
    {
        <statements>
    }
    ```

- The "condition" in parentheses can be any expression that produces a `bool` value, including all of the combinations of conditions we saw in the previous lecture (Booleans and Comparisons). It can even be a `bool` variable, since a `bool` variable "contains" a `bool` value.
- Note that there is no semicolon after the `if (<condition>)`. It's a kind of "header" for the following block of code, like a method header.
- The statements in the code block will be executed if the condition evaluates to `true`, or skipped if it evaluates to `false`
- If the code block contains only *one* statement, the curly braces can be omitted, producing the following syntax:

    ```
    if(<condition>)
        <statement>
    ```

    For example, the `if` statement in our previous example could be written like this, since there was only one statement in the code block:

    ```
    if(age >= 18)
        Console.WriteLine("You can vote!");
    Console.WriteLine("Goodbye");
    ```

- Omitting the curly braces is slightly dangerous, though, because it makes it less obvious which line of code is controlled by the `if` statement. It is up to you, the programmer, to remember to indent the line after the `if` statement, and then de-indent the line after that; indentation is just a convention. Curly braces make it easier to see where the `if` statement starts and ends.

## if-else Statements

Example:

```
if(age >= 18)
{
    Console.WriteLine("You can vote!");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("You are too young to vote");
}
Console.WriteLine("Goodbye");
```

- The **if-else statement** is a decision structure that chooses *which* block of code to execute, based on whether a condition is true or false
- In this example, the condition is `age >= 18` again
- The first block of code (underneath the `if`) will be executed if the statement is true -- the console will display "You can vote!"
- The *second* block of code, which comes after the keyword `else`, will be executed if the statement is *false* -- so if the user's age is less than 18, the console will display "You are too young to vote"
- Only one of these blocks of code will be executed; the other will be skipped
- After executing one of the two code blocks, execution continues at the next line after the `else` block, so in either case the console will next display "Goodbye"
- The behavior of this program can be represented by this flowchart:

    !["A flowchart representation of an if-else statement"](img/activity_diag_vote_if_else)

### Syntax and comparison
- Formally, the syntax for an `if-else` statement is this:

    ```
    if (<condition>)
    {
        <statement block 1>
    }
    else
    {
        <statement block 2>
    }
    ```

- As with the `if` statement, the condition can be anything that produces a `bool` value
- Note that there is no semicolon after the `else` keyword
- If the condition is true, the code in statement block 1 is executed (this is sometimes called the "if block"), and statement block 2 is skipped
- If the condition is false, the code in statement block 2 is executed (this is sometimes called the "else block"), and statement block 1 is skipped
- This is very similar to an if statement; the difference is what happens if the condition is false
    - With an `if` statement, the "if block" is executed if the condition is true, but *nothing happens* if the condition is false.
    - With an `if-else` statement, the code in the "else block" is executed if the condition is false, so something always happens - one of the two code blocks will get executed


## Nested if-else Statements

- If-else statements are used to change program flow based on a condition; they represent making a decision
- Sometimes decisions are more complex than a single yes/no question: once you know whether a certain condition is true or false, you then need to ask another question (check another condition) based on the outcome
- For example, we could improve our voting program to ask the user whether he/she is a US citizen, as well as his/her age. This means there are two conditions to evaluate, as shown in this flowchart:

    !["A flowchart representation of the nested if-else statement"](img/activity_diag_vote_nested_if)

    - First, the program should test whether the user is a citizen. If not, there is no need to check the user's age, since he/she cannot vote anyway
    - If the user is a citizen, the program should then test whether the user is over 18 to determine if he/she is old enough to vote.

### Using nested if statements

- An `if` statement's code block can contain any kind of statements, including another `if` statement
- Putting an `if` statement inside an if block represents making a sequence of decisions - once execution has reached the inside of an if block, your program "knows" that the `if` condition is true, so it can proceed to make the next decision
- For the voting example, we can implement the decision structure from the flowchart above with this code, assuming `age` is an `int` and `usCitizen` is a `bool`:

    ```
    if(usCitizen == true)
    {
        if(age >= 18)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("You can vote!");
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("You are too young to vote");
        }
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Sorry, only citizens can vote");
    }
    Console.WriteLine("Goodbye");
    ```

    - First, the program tests the condition `usCitizen == true`, and if it is true, the code in the first "if block" is executed
    - Within this if block is another `if` statement that tests the condition `age >= 18`. This represents checking the user's age after determining that he/she is a US citizen - execution only reaches this second `if` statement if the first one evaluated to true. So "You can vote" is printed if both `usCitizen == true` and `age >= 18`
    - If the condition `usCitizen == true` is false, the if block is skipped and the else block is executed instead, so the entire inner `if` statement is never executed -- the user's age does not matter if he/she isn't a citizen
    - Note that the condition `usCitizen == true` could also be expressed by just writing the name of the variable `usCitizen` (i.e., the if statement would be `if(usCitizen)`), because `usCitizen` is a `bool` variable. We do not need the equality comparison operator to test if it is `true`, because an `if` statement already tests whether its condition is `true` (and a `bool` variable by itself is a valid condition)
    - Note that indentation helps you match up an `else` block to its corresponding `if` block. The meaning of `else` depends on which `if` statement it goes with: the "outer" `else` will be executed if the condition `usCitizen == true` is false, while the "inner" `else` will be executed if the condition `age >= 18` is false.

- Nested `if` statements do not need to be the *only* code in the if block; you can still write other statements before or after the nested `if`
- For example, we could change our voting program so that it only asks for the user's age if he/she is a citizen:

    ```
    if(usCitizen == true)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Enter your age");
        int age = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
        if(age >= 18)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("You can vote!");
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("You are too young to vote");
        }
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Sorry, only citizens can vote");
    }
    Console.WriteLine("Goodbye");
    ```


## if-else-if Statements

- Sometimes your program needs to test multiple conditions at once, and take different actions depending on which one is true
- Example: We want to write a program that tells the user which floor a `ClassRoom` object is on, based on its room number
    - If the room number is between 100 and 200 it is on the first floor; if it is between 200 and 300 it is on the second floor; if it is greater than 300 it is on the third floor
- There are 3 ranges of numbers to test, and 3 possible results, so we cannot do it with a single if-else statement

### If-else-if syntax

- An if-else-if statement looks like this:

    ```
    if(<condition 1>)
    {
        <statement block 1>
    }
    else if(<condition 2>)
    {
        <statement block 2>
    }
    else if(<condition 3>)
    {
        <statement block 3>
    }
    else
    {
        <statement block 4>
    }
    ```

- Unlike an `if` statement, there are multiple conditions
- They are evaluated *in order*, top to bottom
- Just like with `if-else`, exactly one block of code will get executed
- If condition 1 is true, statement block 1 is executed, and everything else is skipped
- If condition 1 is false, statement block 1 is skipped, and execution proceeds to the first `else if` line; condition 2 is then evaluated
- If condition 2 is true, statement block 2 is executed, and everything else is skipped
    - Thus, statement block 2 is only executed if condition 1 is false *and* condition 2 is true
- Same process repeats for condition 3: If condition 2 is false, condition 3 is evaluated, and statement block 3 is either executed or skipped
- If *all* the conditions are false, the final else block (statement block 4) is executed

### Using if-else-if to solve the "floors problem"

- Assuming `myRoom` is a `ClassRoom` object, this code will display which floor it is on:

    ```
    if(myRoom.GetNumber() >= 300)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Third floor");
    }
    else if(myRoom.GetNumber() >= 200)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Second floor");
    }
    else if(myRoom.GetNumber() >= 100)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("First floor");
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Invalid room number");
    }
    ```

- If the room number 300 or greater (e.g. 365), the first "if" block is executed, and the rest are skipped. The program prints "Third floor"
- If the room number is less than 300, the program continues to the line `else if(myRoom.GetNumber() >= 200)` and evaluates the condition
- If `myRoom.GetNumber() >= 200` is true, it means the room number is between 200 and 299, and the program will print "Second floor." Even though the condition only tests whether the room number is >= 200, this condition is only evaluated if the first one was false, so we know the room number must be < 300.
- If the second condition is false, the program continues to the line `else if(myRoom.GetNumber() >= 100)`, evaluates the condition, and prints "First floor" if it is true.
- Again, the condition `myRoom.GetNumber() >= 100` is only evaluated if the first two conditions have already been tested and turned out false, so we know the room number is less than 300 and less than 200.
- In the final `else` block, the program prints "Invalid room number" because this block is only executed if the room number is less than 100 (all three conditions were false).

### if-else-if with different conditions

- We often use if-else-if statements to test the same variable multiple times, but there is no requirement for the conditions to use the same variable
- An if-else-if statement can use several different variables, and its conditions can be completely unrelated, like this:

    ```
    int x;
    if(myIntVar > 12)
    {
        x = 10;
    }
    else if(myStringVar == "Yes")
    {
        x = 20;
    }
    else if(myBoolVar)
    {
        x = 30;
    }
    else
    {
        x = 40;
    }
    ```

- Note that the order of the else-if statements still matters, because they are evaluated top-to-bottom. If `myIntVar` is 15, it does not matter what values `myStringVar` or `myBoolVar` have, because the first if block (setting `x` to 10) will get executed.
- Example outcomes of executing this code (which value `x` is assigned) based on the values of `myIntVar`, `myStringVar`, and `myBoolVar`:

    | `myIntVar` | `myStringVar` | `myBoolVar` | `x` |
    | ---        | ---           | ---         | --- |
    | 12         | "Yes"         | `true`      | 20  |
    | 15         | "Yes"         | `false`     | 10  |
    | -15        | "yes"         | `true`      | 30  |
    | 10         | "yes"         | `false`     | 40  |

### Comparing if-else-if and nested if statements

- Sometimes a nested `if` statement can be rewritten as an `if-else-if` statement

- This reduces the amount of indentation in your code, which makes it easier to read

- To convert a nested `if` statement to `if-else-if`, you'll need to combine the conditions of the "outer" and "inner" `if` statements, using the logical operators

- A nested `if` statement inside an `if` block is testing whether the outer `if`'s condition is true *and* its own condition is true, so combine them with the `&&` operator

- The `else` block of the inner `if` statement can be rewritten as an `else if` by combining the outer `if`'s condition with the *opposite* of the inner `if`'s condition, since "else" means "the condition is false." We need to explicitly write down the "false condition" that is normally implied by `else`.

- For example, we can rewrite this nested `if` statement:

    ```
    if(usCitizen == true)
    {
        if(age >= 18)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("You can vote!");
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("You are too young to vote");
        }
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Sorry, only citizens can vote");
    }
    ```

    as this `if-else-if` statement:

    ```
    if(usCitizen == true && age >= 18)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("You can vote!");
    }
    else if(usCitizen == true && age < 18)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("You are too young to vote");
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Sorry, only citizens can vote");
    }
    ```

- Note that the `else` from the inner if statement becomes `else if(usCitizen == true && age < 18)` because we combined the outer if condition (`usCitizen == true`) with the opposite of the inner if condition (`age >= 18`).

- Not all nested `if` statements can be rewritten this way. If there is additional code in a block, other than the nested `if` statement, it is harder to convert it to an if-else-if

- For example, in this nested `if` statement:

    ```
    if(usCitizen == true)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Enter your age");
        int age = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
        if(age >= 18)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("You can vote!");
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("You are too young to vote");
        }
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Sorry, only citizens can vote");
    }
    Console.WriteLine("Goodbye");
    ```

    the code that asks for the user's age executes after the outer `if` condition is determined to be true, but before the inner `if` condition is tested. There would be nowhere to put this code if we tried to convert it to an if-else-if statement, since both conditions must be tested at the same time (in `if(usCitizen == true && age >= 18)`).

- On the other hand, any if-else-if statement can be rewritten as a nested `if` statement

- To convert an if-else-if statement to a nested `if` statement, rewrite each `else if` as an `else` block with a nested `if` statement inside it -- like you're splitting the "if" from the "else"

- This results in a lot of indenting if there are many `else if` lines, since each one becomes another nested `if` inside an `else` block

- For example, the "floors problem" could be rewritten like this:

    ```
    if(myRoom.GetNumber() >= 300)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Third floor");
    }
    else
    {
        if(myRoom.GetNumber() >= 200)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Second floor");
        }
        else
        {
            if(myRoom.GetNumber() >= 100)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("First floor");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Invalid room number");
            }
        }
    }
    ```
