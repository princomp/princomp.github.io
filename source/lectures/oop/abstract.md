# Abstract Classes

## Motivation

Consider the following situation:

- We want to implement a class for students, and one for employees.
- We realize that those class overlap heavily: they both need properties for an id, a name, an emergency phone number, an address, etc., identical methods to e.g., implement an automated alert system, etc.
- However, they do not overlap perfectly: for example, students will have a major but employees won't, and employee will have an hourly wage but students won't. Also, some checks will be different: while both students and employees will have an id, the former will always have to start with the letter 'S', but the latter won't have any requirement.
- So we really do need two different classes, but would like for them both to inherit a "Person" class that implements all the overlapping properties, attributes and methods.
- **But** we **do not** want persons "objects" to be created: a "person" in isolation does not make sense in our model, we only want to implement students or employees, not "persons".

The mechanism used to obtain this behavior (being able to inherit from a class while disallowing instantiating it) is achieved using the `abstract` keyword.

## Example

Consider a (shortened) version of the example above. We start by implementing an *abstract* `Person` class:

```
!include code/projects/AbstractClass/AbstractClass/Person.cs
```

Note that the `Id` property is *also* marked as `abstract`: this means that the derived class will have to re-implement this property's setter and getter.
Then, we can implement the `Student` and `Employee` classes by inheriting from the `Person` class:

```
!include code/projects/AbstractClass/AbstractClass/Student.cs
```

```
!include code/projects/AbstractClass/AbstractClass/Employee.cs
```

Note that the `Employee` does not need to add an attribute for `Id` since it is using automatic properties, but that `Student` does.

Using this code, the statement

```
Person test = new Person();
```

would return the error message "Cannot create an instance of the abstract type or interface 'Person'".

Furthermore, the following exemplifies the expected behavior:

```
!include code/projects/AbstractClass/AbstractClass/Program.cs
```

The statement `Morgan.Id = "E8194";` will raise exception, but `Morgan.Id = "S8194";` will execute without throwing an error.

## Additional Details: Abstract Properties and Methods

- As we've seen above with the `Id` property, not only classes can be marked as abstract.
- For abstract properties, using `{get; set;}`, only `{get;}` or only `{set;}` indicates if the derived class needs to implement both a setter and a getter, or only one of them.
- In addition to properties, *methods* can also be marked as abstract: in that case, their body need to be absent (not simply empty: missing).

    - For example, the `Person` class could also contain
    
        ```
        public abstract string GenerateLogin();
        ```
        to "force" any derived class to implement a `GenerateLogin` method that does not take any parameter and returns a `string`. The derived classes would need to implement a method that overrides the `Person`'s `GenerateLogin` method^[Which should have the same signature *and* return type.]:

        ```
        public override string GenerateLogin(){
            // Insert method body.
        }
        ```

        Note that an `abstract` method is implicitly a `virtual` method, as it *must* be overridden. Hence, no need to specify the `virtual` modifier.

- However, abstract attributes are not allowed.

## UML Class Diagram Representation

- An abstract class is represented by as a class with its name prefixed by `<<Abstract>>`,  `«Abstract»`, or with its name displayed in *italics*,
- An abstract method or property is represented as a usual, except that it is displayed in *italics*.
- Since, for example, `Person`'s `GenerateLogin()` method is to be overridden (it _has_ to be, actually, since it is abstract), it is indicated again in the `Student` and `Employee` classes: this indicates that those method override the one they have inherited from the `Person` class.
