# Computers and Programming

## Principles of Computer Programming

- Computer hardware changes frequently - from room-filling machines with punch cards and tapes to modern laptops and tablets - and will continue doing so.
- With these changes, the capabilities of computers increase rapidly (storage, speed, graphics, etc.)
- Computer programming languages also change
    - Better programming language theory leads to new programming techniques
    - Improved programming language implementations
    - New languages are created, old ones updated
- There are [hundreds of programming languages](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/List_of_programming_languages), why?
    - Different tools for different jobs
        - Some languages are better suited for certain jobs
        - For example, Python is best for scripting, Javascript is best for web pages, MySQL is best for databases, etc.
    - Personal preference and popularity
- This class is about "principles" of computer programming
    - Common principles behind all languages will not change, even though hardware and languages do
    - How to organize and structure data
    - How to express logical conditions and relations
    - How to solve problems with programs

## Programming Language Concepts

We begin by discussing three categories of languages manipulated by computers.
We will be studying and writing programs in _high-level languages_, but understanding their differences and relationships to other languages^[That will be studied in the course of your study if you continue as a CS major.] is of importance to become familiar with them.

- Machine language
    - Computers are made of electronic circuits
        - Circuits are components connected by wires
        - Some wires carry data - e.g. numbers
        - Some carry control signals - e.g. do an add or a subtract operation
    - Instructions are settings on these control signals
        - A setting is represented as a 0 or 1
        - A machine language instruction is a group of settings - For example: `1000100111011000`
    - Most CPUs use one of two languages: x86 or ARM
- Assembly language
    - Easier way for humans to write machine-language instructions
    - Instead of 1s and 0s, it uses letters and "words" to represent an instruction.
        - Example x86 instruction: 
        ```
        MOV BX, AX
        ```
        which makes a copy of data stored in a component called AX and places it in one called BX
    - **Assembler**: Translates assembly language instructions to machine language instructions
        - For example: `MOV BX, AX` translates into `1000100111011000`
        - One assembly instruction = one machine-language instruction
        - x86 assembly produces x86 machine code
    - Computers can only execute the machine code
- High-level language
    - Hundreds including C#, C++, Java, Python, etc.
    - Most programs are written in a high-level language since:
        - More human-readable than assembly language
        - High-level concepts such as processing a collection of items are easier to write and understand
        - Takes less code since each statement might be translated into several assembly instructions
    - **Compiler**: Translates high-level language to machine code
        - Finds "spelling" errors but not problem-solving errors
        - Incorporates code libraries – commonly used pieces of code previously written such as Math.Sqrt(9)
        - Optimizes high-level instructions – your code may look very different after it has been optimized
        - Compiler is specific to both the source language and the target computer
    - Compile high-level instructions into machine code then execute since computers can only execute machine code

![A Visual Representation of the Relationships Between Languages](img/overview_languages_1)

A more subtle difference exists between high-level languages.
Some (like C) are _compiled_ (as we discussed above), some (like Python) are _interpreted_, and some (like C#) are in an in-between called _managed_.

- Compiled vs. Interpreted languages
    - Not all high-level languages use a compiler - some use an interpreter
    - **Interpreter**: Lets a computer "execute" high-level code by translating one statement at a time to machine code
    - Advantage: Less waiting time before you can execute the program (no separate "compile" step)
    - Disadvantage: Program executes slower since you wait for the high-level statements to be translated then the program is executed
- Managed high-level languages (like C#)
    - Combine features of compiled and interpreted languages
    - Compiler translates high-level statements to **intermediate language** instructions, not machine code
        - Intermediate language: Looks like assembly language, but not specific to any CPU
    - **run-time** executes by *interpreting* the intermediate language instructions - translates one at a time to machine code
        - Faster since translation is partially done already (by compiler), only a simple "last step" is done when executing the program
    - Advantages of managed languages:
        - In a "non-managed" language, a compiled program only works on one OS + CPU combination (**platform**) because it is machine code
        - Managed-language programs can be reused on a different platform without recompiling - intermediate language is not machine code and not CPU-specific
        - Still need to write an intermediate language interpreter for each platform (so it produces the right machine code), but, for a non-managed language, you must write a compiler for each platform
        - Writing a compiler is more complicated and more work than writing an interpreter thus an interpreter is a quicker (and cheaper) way to put your language on different platforms
        - Intermediate-language interpreter is much faster than a high-level language interpreter, so programs execute faster than an "interpreted language" like Python
    - This still executes slower than a non-managed language (due to the interpreter), so performance-minded programmers use non-managed compiled languages (e.g. for video games)

## Software Concepts

- Flow of execution in a program
    - Program receives input from some source, e.g. keyboard, mouse, data in files
    - Program uses input to make decisions
    - Program produces output for the outside world to see, e.g. by displaying images on screen, writing text to console, or saving data in files
- Program interfaces
    - **GUI** or Graphical User Interface: Input is from clicking mouse in visual elements on screen (buttons, menus, etc.), output is by drawing onto the screen
    - **CLI** or Command Line Interface: Input is from text typed into "command prompt" or "terminal window," output is text printed at same terminal window
    - This class will use CLI because it is simple, portable, easy to work with -- no need to learn how to draw images, just read and write text

## Programming Concepts

### Programming workflow

![Flowchart demonstrating roles and tasks of a programmer, beta tester and user in the creation of programs.](img/flowchart){#fig:flowchart1}

The workflow of the programmer will differ a bit depending on if the program is written in a compiled or an intprepreted programming language.
From the distance, both looks like what is pictured in the [the flowchart demonstrating roles and tasks of a programmer, beta tester and user in the creation of programs](#fig:flowchart1), but some differences remain:

- Compiled language workflow
    - Writing down specifications
    - Creating the source code
    - Running the compiler
    - Reading the compiler's output, warning and error messages
    - Fixing compile errors, if necessary
    - Executing and testing the program
    - Debugging the program, if necessary
- Interpreted language workflow
    - Writing down specifications
    - Creating the source code
    - Executing the program in the interpreter
    - Reading the interpreter's output, determining if there is a syntax (language) error or the program finished executing
    - Editing the program to fix syntax errors
    - Testing the program (once it can execute with no errors)
    - Debugging the program, if necessary
    
Interpreted languages have

- **Advantages**: Fewer steps between writing and executing, can be a faster cycle
- **Disadvantages**: All errors happen when you execute the program, no distinction between syntax errors (compile errors) and logic errors (bugs in executing program)

### (Integrated) Development Environment

Programmers can either use a collection of tools to write, compile, debug and execute a program, or use an "all-in-one" solution called an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

- The ["Unix philosophy"](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Unix_philosophy) states that a program should do only one task, and do it properly. For programmers, this means that
    - One program will be needed to edit the source code, a text editor (it can be Geany, notepad, kwrite, emacs, sublime text, vi, etc.),
    - One program will be needed to compile the source code, a compiler (for C#, it will be either [mono](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Mono_(software)) or [Roslyn](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Roslyn_(compiler)),
    - Other programs may be needed to debug, execute, or organize larger projects, such as makefile or [MKBundle](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/tools+libraries/tools/mkbundle/).

IDE "bundle" all of those functionality into a single interface, to ease the workflow of the programmer.
This means sometimes that programmers have fewer control over their tools, but that it is easier to get started.
    
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
    - Combines a text editor, compiler, file browser, debugger, and other tools
    - Helps you organize a programming project
    - Helps you write, compile, and test code in one place

In particular, Visual Studio is an IDE, and it uses its own vocabulary:

- Solution: An entire software project, including source code, metadata, input data files, etc.
- "Build solution": Compile all of your code
- "Start without debugging": Execute the compiled code
- Solution location: The folder (on your computer's file system) that contains the solution, meaning all your code and the information needed to compile and execute it
