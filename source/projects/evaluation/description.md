# Description

## Purpose

This project is designed to teach you how to interpret and implement a simple UML specification involving multiple classes.
It involves inheritance, polymorphism, properties, exception handling and `String` methods.

## Challenge

### In short

Develop multiple classes to organize the evaluations for courses. 
Evaluations can be of different natures (project, in-class exam, finale exam), have different weights and be marked as optional.
However, evaluations of different natures also have different attributes and methods: for example, only projects have a submission link, and only exams have a room.

### In more details

We want to implement the classes pictured in the UML diagram (you can zoom in or, in your browser, right click and select "Open Image in New Tab", or access [its text version](./uml/cla/Evaluation.txt)).

!include diag/cla/Evaluation.md

Remembering  that:

- Static methods are u͟n͟d͟e͟r͟l͟i͟n͟e͟d͟,
- Abstract methods are *in italics*.

Your code should be such that the following:

```
!include code/projects/Evaluation/Evaluation/Program.cs
```

should display (something along the lines of)

```text

Evaluations are for different classes.

**Pay attention to details** in the code above. For example, your code should be such that:

- An exception will be raised if the url for the project's submission link does not start with "https://lms.augusta.edu/d2l/lms/",
- For exams (in-class or finale exam), the room should be displayed if it is provided, otherwise, "Same as class meeting room." should be displayed if the exam in in-class, and "Check the Registrar's exam schedules for " (followed by the course property) should be displayed if the exam is the final exam,
- For all string attributes and properties, `null` or empty strings should *not* make the program crash,
- The *static* `IntegrityTest` method should take as input a list of evaluations, and returns `true` if all the evaluations belong to the same course and the weights of the evaluations that are not bonuses adds to 1, `false` if the evaluations all belong to the same course but the weights of the evaluations that are not bonuses do not add to 1, and raise an exception otherwise,
- `Final` and `InClass` do *not* have `ToString()` methods, and yet displaying information about them still return information about the room.

## Submission

Please, follow our [guideline on project submission](./projects/submission).
In particular, make sure you write your name and the date in a delimited comment at the beginning of your file.

## Bonuses

This project is already challenging *as is*, but bonus will be given if:

- (easy) Except in the `Evaluation` class, make it so that the `GetContact()` methods cannot be overridden,
- (medium) Your `Main` method exhibits many test cases and illustrates your classes' features nicely,
- (hard) A mechanism is implemented to either export the attributes of an `Evaluation` object into a file or to load it from a file.
