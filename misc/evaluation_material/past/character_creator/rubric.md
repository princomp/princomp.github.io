# Rubric

Below are the rubrics used to grade each phase of the "Character creation" project.
It is advised to use these rubrics as a way to check your work, along with the solution for the corresponding phase.

## Phase 1

### Additional Info
- For all the getters, setters, and attributes, every error is -0.5pt, with more than one error meaning 0pts in that section. (Do NOT give quarter points)
- For every attribute with an improper name or datatype, take 0.5pt off the 1pt (that is, 2 mistakes result in a 0)
- If the getter or setters are correct w.r.t. the name / datatype of the attribute as implemented by the student, please do not take points off.
- _Any_ `ToString` is considered valid, as long as it compiles and returns a `string`.
